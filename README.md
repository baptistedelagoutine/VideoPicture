# Video Recorder Player

This software has been developed for specific needs, and that is why some features may seem weird. :)
The software is in French.

## Features
* displays stream from USB cameras
* records the stream in an uncompressed video file (can be GB)
* automatically stops the record after x seconds, defined by the user
* plays the recorded video, can be done frame by frame (AForge can't, so I did it myself)
* from the played video, the user can grab up to 6 pictures

## Shortcuts
* F1 and F2 to change the mode (record or play)
* Space to start/stop recording the video
* Space to play/pause the video
* Enter to grab a picture in Player mode
* Left and Right arrows to navigate frame by frame in Player mode

## Made with
* .Net 2, C# and WinForms
* AForge.Net: http://www.aforgenet.com/
* Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition
